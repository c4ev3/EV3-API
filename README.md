# EV3-API [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/c4ev3/EV3-API.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/c4ev3/EV3-API) [![Gitter Chat](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/c4ev3/Lobby?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)

This API supports the follwing functionallity:
* Easy initialization with one header-file
* Controlling LEGO motors
* Reading out of Touch, Ultrasonic, Color, Gyro, EV3-Infrared, NXT-Infrared Sensor and NXT Temperaturesensor
* Controling Buttons and LED
* Printing text on LCD
* Playing sounds

The basis of this API was developed by [John Hansen](http://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/test_releases/)
and [Carsten Zeiffert](https://github.com/carstenz/ev3sensor/).
These API's were merged and extended.

## Building from source
If you change something in the source, rebuild with a simple `make` (with MinGW, it's called `mingw32-make`).

Unless you are using the Eclipse Plugin, you will also need to explicitly link against the static `.a` file generated like so:
`-L/path/to/libev3api -lev3api`.
